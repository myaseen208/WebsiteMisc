# Beneficiary Assessment Study of BISP Kafalaat Beneficiaries
## Survey Background
The BISP is exploring a number of options for streamlining its payment model, in view of complaints of deductions by POS agents. In this regard, the Payment Mechanisms Committee of BISP Board has directed that a beneficiary assessment study needs to be conducted to obtain feedback and opinion of BISP beneficiaries to determine which model would be best suited for catering to their requirements. For this purpose, the Policy and Research Unit of BISP has developed a short survey questionnaire for gathering relevant information from BISP beneficiaries across the country, in collaboration with the CT Wing. The information for this survey will be collected from each tehsil office of BISP across Pakistan. In view of the urgency of carrying out this exercise, Secretary BISP has desired that this survey activity should be completed in the next 10-14 days.
